Product Based Software Engineering - Project #1 

1. Introduction 
The product based software engineering approach allows a developer to create a software system based on an 
original idea. The system could be an improvement over existing systems such as a cloud based accounting system; 
a generalization of a system that was developed for a specific customer such as an asset management system; or a 
entertaining or educational game. Software product ideas are limitless.  

Challenge Statement:  
Due to the pandemic and the shift to online learning, the education system continues to face multiple challenges in 
terms of the quality and delivery of education. Tech-based solutions can bridge the gap in learning and streamline 
the education system. 
 
The education system includes, students at all levels, parents, schools, administration and the effects of quality 
education can have long-term implications on how things evolve in the world 
 
Develop a solution that can address on of the following: 
 
#1 Shared or online learning experiences  
#2 Increase student engagement  
#3 Teacher and/or student resources  
#4 Student assessment of skills and interest finder  
#5 Wildcard within the scope 
Students will work together in teams of 4 members. Students are responsible for developing a project idea, 
determining the features and how to work together to implement those features.   
Overall Objectives 
• Gain experience with the software engineering Agile methodology. 
o Learn the agile methodology 
o Project planning, backlog, forecasting, and retrospectives. 
o Learn continuous integration, collaboration, version control and software testing. 
• Work in a team oriented environment. 
o Task distribution, communication and coordination. 
o Learn to break down tasks and define responsibilities. 
o Learn to use supporting tools for team collaboration. 
• Create solution systematically. 
o Learn to create design models. 
o Develop implementation that is consistent with design. 
2. Project Path 
1. Opportunity – Select a Challenge Statements  
2. Determine the solution to the problem 
3. Product design – Requirements analysis and software architecture and design  
4. Build the software – Configuration Management, Software Test, Programming 
5. Software Documentation 
3. Grading Policy 
Each member of the team is expected to contribute equally to the project. Note that project grades will be given on 
an individual basis. In other words, if one person does not contribute substantially to the project, his/her grade will 
be significantly reduced. Peer Evaluations will be based on ranking of your teammates. If there is a clear 
discrepancy in individual contributions, justification may be required and individual project grades will be adjusted 
accordingly. You will be evaluated on your team role, project contribution, and code commit data. 
4. Team Roles 
Each team must appoint the following roles.  Note: It may be cases where a person can have multiple roles such as 
the project leader can also be a frontend developer. 
1. Product Manager  
2. Scrum Master 
3. Development Team Member  
4. Development Team Member 
 Collaboration Tools 
You are required to use the following tools for tracking project activities. Integrated with version control: 
o Github 
o CICD 
o Project Management Tool  
o Agile Methods and Tools 
Tips 
While there is no magic formula for successful teamwork, the following are helpful tips from my observations of 
successful teams in the past. 
• Set up a regular team meeting. Take notes during the team meeting and post them. At the end of the meeting, 
make sure that each member is clear about his or her work items. Track attendance for each meeting. 
• Assign work items to individuals. Pair Programming is highly encouraged. 
• Record work items in a project tracking system for accountability. 
• Nonresponsive teammates disrupt the smooth functioning of the team and can wreak havoc on the morale of 
the team. Report nonresponsive teammates immediately. These include but are not limited to, (a) those who 
have repeatable absences (3 or more times) with no excuse, (b) those who repeatedly fail to respond to queries, 
(c) those who continually neglect their work items. 
5. Deliverables 
• Project Proposal/ Configuration Management   2/7 
• User Stories/Backlog         2/20 
• Software Architecture        2/27 
• Sprint Review 1          2/21 – 2/25 
• Sprint Retrospective        3/4 
• Peer Evaluation                     3/4 
• Software Testing          3/25 
• Sprint Review 2          3/28 – 4/1 
• Sprint Retrospectives         4/8 
• Peer Evaluation                     4/8 
• Sprint Review Final         4/20 
• Project Submission and Final Documentation   4/20 
• Peer Evaluation          4/22   
 
6. Documentation 
Your final documentation should include: 
Title Page with course information and team information  
Table of contents  
• Product vision statement. 
• Project overview. 
• Software Quality Plan 
• Risk Analysis  
• Requirements documentation. Provide an overview of what the system does, explanation of 
features and user interface details. 
• System documentation. Provide an overview of the system, including system architecture 
details and System Context Model explained. 
• Developer documentation. README File, Logins, API Keys ect 
7. Presentations – Sprint Review 
All cameras on. Presentations are 10 mins each. Each team member is required to present. The 
presentation should include team members and roles, product purpose, work completed, demo, review of 
completed assignments or artifacts, future plans, and any issues encountered. A presentation deck is 
required. 
 
• Sprint 1 Review         2/21 – 2/25 
• Sprint 2 Review        3/28 – 4/1 
• Final Sprint Review       4/20 
Notes 
• Teams will be expected to work out a plan of internal tasks that are consistent with these deadlines. 
• Feedback should be incorporated into a revised version of the deliverable and resubmitted for re-review.  
• When resubmitting a deliverable, include a brief item-by-item explanation how each comment was addressed.
